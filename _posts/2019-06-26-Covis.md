## Motivation <br>
Point clouds of reference and target can be generated by some technique (SfM, LiDAR sensor, Kinect range camera...). Cases in which reference and target point clouds generated by **(<font color="#dd0000">only for two linearly separable class</font>)different technologies** are rarely discussed. However, in real world, the challenges of corss-source point clouds registration are commonly encountered.

## Introduction
* One popular point cloud registration: ICP (Iterative Closet Point) <- based on same type of sensor
* Some challenges for registration of cross-source point cloud 
> 1. different dimension of scale
>     - SfM: no real scale information
>     - LiDAR: can be calibrated through earth coordinates
> 2. different density of point cloud
>     - density(LiDAR) > density(SfM)
> 3. different noise distribution
> 4. point cloud overlapped problem

## Main Algorithm
* Two stages: coarse matching + fine registration
> coarse matching:
>  1. apply multi-scale scanning on LiDAR 
>  2. apply ESF-64 on LiDAR and SfM point clouds
>  3. select k-best similar LiDAR cloud point cloud regions in each scale for reference (use cosine similarity)
      (Ques: regions? means "points"?)
>
> fine registration:
>  0. alignment for vetical direction in a SfM and LiDAR cloud point (since objects are vertical in the urban environmnet)
>   -> reduce the number of initial poses to save computing cost and avoid obvious incorrect initial poses, thereby improving accuracy
> 1. apply ICP with multiple initial poses (since ICP is easy to stick in local optimum)
>   (Ques: what does initial pose means?)
> 2. after ICP registration, the optimal transformation matrix (RT matrix) is found

## Motivation
Point clouds of reference and target can be generated by some technique (SfM, LiDAR sensor, Kinect range camera...). Cases in which reference and target point clouds generated by `different technologies` are rarely discussed. However, in real world, the challenges of corss-source point clouds registration are commonly encountered.

## Difficulty
* One popular point cloud registration: ICP (Iterative Closet Point)
  - based on same type of sensor
* Some challenges for registration of cross-source point cloud <br>
  - different dimension of scale <br>
     - SfM: no real scale information <br>
     - LiDAR: can be calibrated through earth coordinates <br>
  - different density of point cloud <br>
     - density(LiDAR) > density(SfM) <br> 
  - different noise distribution <br>
  - point cloud overlapped problem <br>

## Main Algorithm
* Two stages: `coarse matching + fine registration` <br> <br>
 - coarse matching: <br>
   - apply multi-scale scanning on LiDAR <br>
   - apply ESF-64 on LiDAR and SfM point clouds <br>
   - select k-best similar LiDAR cloud point cloud regions <br>
     in each scale for reference (use cosine similarity) <br> <br>
 - fine registration: <br>
   - alignment for vetical direction <br>
     in a SfM and LiDAR cloud point <br>
     (since objects are vertical in the urban environmnet) <br>
      - reduce the number of initial poses <br>
         to save computing cost and avoid obvious incorrect initial poses, <br>
         thereby improving accuracy <br>
   - apply ICP with multiple initial poses <br>
     (since ICP is easy to stick in local optimum) <br>
   - optimal transformation matrix (RT matrix) is found <br>
   - residual of registration: ICP-score <br>
      - lower ICP-score is the higher ranked candidate <br>
   - adjustment for ICP score <br>
     (since ICP-score favors small scale candicate point clouds) <br>
      - a penalty factor is performed in ajdusted ICP-score <br>
   - sort ajusted ICP-score in ascending order <br>

## Motivation
- to achieve cm-level accuracy localization, relying only on GPS sensor is not enough

--- 

## Proposed scheme
- take into account the information from different sensors and a high precision map
- use graph smoother `instead of filter techniques` to estimate the vehicle pose
- view the localization problem as `constraints between vehicle poses and landmarks`
- vehicle node => soft node; landmark => fixed node (fixed nodes will not be estimated)

- motion model
  - vehicle pose at time t: (x<sub>t</sub>, y<sub>t</sub>, θ<sub>t</sub>)
  - with odometry information, the vechicle pose at time (t+1) can be inferred
  - motion constraint: o<sub>i</sub> = (∆x<sub>i</sub>, ∆y<sub>i</sub>, ∆θ<sub>i</sub>) between nodes i and i+1

- observation model
  - LIDAR data => static grid map => extract feature points by open source blob detector
  - in the form of (z<sub>t,1</sub>, z<sub>t,2</sub>, ...) , where z<sub>t,i</sub> = (x<sub>t,i</sub>, y<sub>t,i</sub>) in the vehicle coordinate system 
  - the image sequences from the camera are processed to get the offset and heading angle to lane markings

- data assocation
  - enable a `multi-modal selector` to find the correspondences (via NNS)
  - use `scaled convariance method` to deal with false positive data association
  - after each iteration in the graph optimization, the best associated feature points will be `re-selected`

- graph optimization 
  - assuming the observations are affected by `Gaussian noise` and the data association is known
  - to compute the best configuration of the posterior over the vehicle trajectory
  - each pose node is initialized by a GPS signal
  - iteratively minimize the cost function to update the position of pose node until convergence
  - cost function inovlves in motion, feature point, lane marking measurements
  - solved by Gauss-Newton algorithm and Cholesky factorization

## Experiment setup
- four Velodyne VLP-16s are mounted at the four corners of our research car
- camera is behind the windshield and points in the driving direction
- INS/GNSS system is mounted at the car’s center of gravity
- map is provided by 3D Mapping Solutions GmbH
- lane and landmark information are stored in a PostgreSQL database
- experimental results in terms of RMSE：
  - lateral：90 % is < 0.35 m
  - longitudinal：90 % is < 0.50 m
  - heading：90 % is < 0.41 deg

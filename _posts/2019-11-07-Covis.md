## Paper
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8206264"> Precise Pose Graph Localization with Sparse Point and Lane Features</a>

## Motivation
- to achieve cm-level accuracy localization, we cannot rely on a GPS only

---

## Proposed scheme
- take into account the information from different sensors and a high precision map
- use graph smoother `instead of filter techniques` to estimate the vehicle pose
- view the localization problem as `constraints between vehicle poses and landmarks`
- enable a `multi-modal selector` to find the correspondences
- use `scaled convariance method` to deal with false positive data association
- assuming the observations are affected by `Gaussian noise` and the data association is known
- vehicle node => soft node; landmark => fixed node
- motion model
  - vehicle pose at time t: (x<sub>t</sub>, y<sub>t</sub>, theta<sub>t</sub>)
  - with odometry information, the vechicle pose at time (t+1) can be inferred
- observation model
  - LIDAR data => static grid map => extract feature points by open source blob detector
  -

## Experiment
- visual localization dataset RobotCar Seasons ([Benchamrk](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Sattler_Benchmarking_6DOF_Outdoor_CVPR_2018_paper.html))
- use `DeepLabv3+network` to segment all dataset images and assign a label to each 3D point by maximum voting with reprojecting pixel labels in all its visiable database images
- in the image retrival step, use `NetVLAD` and `pre-trained Pitts30K model` generate `4096-dimensional descriptor vectors` for each query and database images, and normalize L2 distances of the descriptors
- retrival number: k=30 for day conditions; k=50 for night conditions
- precision threshold: high (0.25m, 2deg); mdeium (0.5m, 5deg); coarse (5m, 10deg)
- comparsion with related works: Dense-VLAD, NetVLAD, FAB-MAP, Active Search, CSL, Non-semantic

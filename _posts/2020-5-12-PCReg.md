## Classical
- ICP (Iterative Closest Point)
  - local method
  - heavily rely on inital estimate, and then refine iteratively
  
- Variant ICP
  - Generalized-ICP, RSS, 2009
  - Trimmed-ICP, IMAVIS, 2005
  
- Variant ICP (global method)
  - multiple restarts (Registration of range data using a hybrid simulated annealing and iterative closest point algorithm, ICRA, 2000)
  - graph optimization (Globally consistent registration of terrestrial laser scans via graph optimization, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote
Sensing, 2015)
  - branch-and-bound (Gogma: Globally-optimal gaussian mixture alignment, CVPR, 2016)
  
## Probabilistic based
- Correlation based
  - Robust point set registration using gaussian mixture models, PAMI, 2011
  - A correlation-based approach to robust point set registration, ECCV, 2004 
  
- EM based
  - CPD (Coherent Point Drift), PAMI, 2010
  - JRMPC (Joint Registration of Multiple Point Clouds), ECCV, 2014
  - DARE (Density Adaptive Point Set Registration), CVPR, 2018
    - Desnity adaptive version of JRMPC
    - The **density variation is problematic for standard ML-based approaches** since each 3D-point corresponds to an observation with equal weight. Thus, the registration focuses on regions with high point densities, while neglecting sparse regions

## Key-Point based
- FPFH (Fast Point Feature Histogram), ICRA, 2009

## Plane based
- Efficient and accurate registration of point clouds with plane to plane correspondences, ICCV Workshop, 2017

## Learning based
- PointNetLK, CVPR, 2019
- 3D point cloud registration for localization using a deep neural network auto-encoder, CVPR, 2017

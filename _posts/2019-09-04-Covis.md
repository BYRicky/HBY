- w = # inliers in data / # points in data
- w is not well-known beforehand
- n : # points needed for estimating a model are selected **independently**
- w<sup>n</sup>: the probability that all n points are inliers 
- 1 - w<sup>n</sup>: the probability that at least one of the n points is an outlier
- k : # iterations for RANSAC
- p : desired probability that the RANSAC algorithm provides a useful result
- 1 - p = (1 - w<sup>n</sup>)<sup>k</sup>

## I have a question
---
- a data point which has been picked up once can be selected again in another iteration?

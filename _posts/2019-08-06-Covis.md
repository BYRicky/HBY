## Paper
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8758558"> Keypoint domain triangular features for fast initial alignment of 3D point clouds</a>

---

## Motivation
- Existing initial alignment algorithms usually suffer from the `limited computational efficiency`. The core reason is that existing local geometric features are mainly computed in the point cloud domain, although the raw point clouds are of great redundancy.

## Keypoints

## Proposed method (Keypoint Domain Triangular Feature-based Initial Alignment, KDT-IA)
- a point cloud C and keypoint set K
- keypoints are extracted from C by `Harris 3D detector (H3D)`
- every keypoint p<sub>i</sub> has two nearest neighbors (p<sub>i</sub><sup>nn1</sup> and p<sub>i</sub><sup>nn2</sup>), and these three points forms a triangle
- KDT feature {l<sub>1</sub>, l<sub>2</sub>, l<sub>3</sub>, index(p<sub>i</sub>), index(p<sub>i</sub><sup>nn1</sup>), index(p<sub>i</sub><sup>nn2</sup>)}
- l<sub>1</sub> = dist(p<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>i</sub><sup>nn1</sup>), l<sub>2</sub> = dist(p<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>i</sub><sup>nn2</sup>), l<sub>3</sub> = dist(p<sub>i</sub><sup>nn1</sup>, p<sub>i</sub><sup>nn2</sup>)

## Observation from experiments
- ICP shows some ability in aligning the cross-source point clouds when there is no scale variation and the initialization is very well and no large disorganized outliers.

## I have some questions about this paper
- what does wide baseline strategy means?
- how H<sub>ii'jj'kk'</sub> actually works?
- definition of the large traiangle

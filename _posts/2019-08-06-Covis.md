## Paper
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8758558"> Keypoint domain triangular features for fast initial alignment of 3D point clouds</a>

---

## Motivation
- Existing initial alignment algorithms usually suffer from the `limited computational efficiency`. The core reason is that existing local geometric features are mainly computed in the point cloud domain, although the raw point clouds are of great redundancy.

## Keypoints
- 3D point in one point cloud is in the representation of `KDT feature`
- RANSAC is replaced by `1P-SAC`

## Proposed method (Keypoint Domain Triangular Feature-based Initial Alignment, KDT-IA)
- a point cloud P and keypoint set K
- keypoints are extracted from P by `Harris 3D detector (H3D)`
- every keypoint p<sub>i</sub> has two nearest neighbors (p<sub>i</sub><sup>nn1</sup> and p<sub>i</sub><sup>nn2</sup>), and these three points `forms a triangle`
- KDT feature: 
  - f<sub>KDT</sub>(p<sub>i</sub>) = {l<sub>1</sub>, l<sub>2</sub>, l<sub>3</sub>, idx(p<sub>i</sub>), idx(p<sub>i</sub><sup>nn1</sup>), idx(p<sub>i</sub><sup>nn2</sup>)}
  - l<sub>1</sub> = dist(p<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>i</sub><sup>nn1</sup>), l<sub>2</sub> = dist(p<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>i</sub><sup>nn2</sup>), l<sub>3</sub> = dist(p<sub>i</sub><sup>nn1</sup>, p<sub>i</sub><sup>nn2</sup>)
  - idx is the index of the point in P
  - idx will be used to recall the vertexes of the triangle in the transformation estimation step for `acceleration`
- KDT correspondence:
  - soucre feature set Fs = {f<sub>1</sub><sup>s</sup>, f<sub>2</sub><sup>s</sup>, ...}, target feature set Ft = {f<sub>1</sub><sup>t</sup>, f<sub>2</sub><sup>t</sup>, ...}
  - for every f<sub>i</sub><sup>s</sup> in Fs, search the most similar f<sub>i</sub><sup>t</sup> in Ft (use KD tree)
  - correspondence c<sub>i</sub> is obtained after found the feature pair **(should them be different?)**
  - correspondence set C is then be generated {c<sub>1</sub>. c<sub>2</sub>, ...}
  - sort the C in ascending order, and take the top-K candidates as reduced set C'
- transformation estimation via `1P-SAC` (1 point-based sample consensus)
  - randomly select correspondence c in C' (size of C' is k)
  - calculate the transformation T<sub>i</sub>, and find the number of inliers T<sub>i</sub><sup>inlier</sup>
  - after k iterations, the resultant transformation is T with the largest number of inliers 
  - reduce the computational complexity from O(n<sup>3</sup>) to O(n)

## Observation from experiments
- keypoints detected by H3D, KPQ, and ISS
  - around 1100 keypoints per point cloud yield the best performance
- compared to fast point feature histograms (FPFH)-based method, the local feature statistics histograms
(LFSH)-based method, and Go-ICP approach
- sufficient consistent correspondences have been found and all point cloud pairs are accurately aligned

## I have some questions about this paper
- maybe they can use the `sparse point cloud` to test the performance
- it may take too much time on `finding the nearest neighbors` of one point

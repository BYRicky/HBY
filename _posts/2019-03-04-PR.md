Here is an approach to implement simple perception classifier. I will show you guys the entire steps for this implementation.

First, we choose the Iris dataset. This dataset contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of Iris plant. The first two classes are linearly separable from each other, whereas the last class is not linearly separable. With the limitation of this classifier, we only take the first two classes. The following d steps...

**Step 1: Dealing of the dataset.** <br>
In matlab, we use `textread` to load the dataset with text format. In this dataset, there are four attributes except for the class name and each attribute is separated by comma. The second parameter in `textread` is based on the data type of the dataset (In Iris dataset, the first four features are floating number and the last one is the string, for example, ).
~~~ matlab
[atrb1,atrb2,atrb3,atrb4,className]=textread(filename,'%f%f%f%f%s','delimiter,',');
~~~

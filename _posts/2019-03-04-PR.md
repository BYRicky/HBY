Here is a simple approach to implement perception classifier. I will show you guys the entire steps for this implementation.

First, we choose the Iris dataset. This dataset contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. The first two classes are linearly separable from each other, whereas the last class is not linearly separable. With the limitation of this classifier, we only take the first two classes. The following d steps...

**Step 1: Dealing of the dataset.** <br>
In matlab, we use `textread` to load the dataset with text format.

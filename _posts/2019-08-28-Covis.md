## Paper
<a href="http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2017/html/Liu_Efficient_Global_2D-3D_ICCV_2017_paper.html"> Efficient Global 2D-3D Matching for Camera Localization in a Large-Scale 3D Map</a>

## Motivation
- the most classical used algorithm for point cloud regristration, ICP ,has several limiation and drawbacks
  - the points in two point cloud must overlap
  - trapped in local minimum
  - susceptible to noise and outliers
  
---

## Keypoints
- registration problem → maximum likelihood (ML) estimation problem （by HMM)
- 
  
---

## Review of ICP algorithm
- two stages: correpsondence stage and registration stage
  - 
- variant: ICP associated with orientation information [37]

## Proposed method

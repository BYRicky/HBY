## Paper
<a href="http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_iccv_2017/html/Liu_Efficient_Global_2D-3D_ICCV_2017_paper.html"> Efficient Global 2D-3D Matching for Camera Localization in a Large-Scale 3D Map</a>

## Motivation
- `large-scale` problem lead to ambiguous matches
  - 3D points can be visually similar or even identical (repeated structure)
  - ambiguous matches are almost inevitable
- `local search` will only obtain sub-optimal solution
  - take account of similarities between 2D-3D matches

## Proposed scheme

## I have some questions about this paper
- what is the 3D point representative for a 3D point cloud?

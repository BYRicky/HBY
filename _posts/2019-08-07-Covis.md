## Paper
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8718799"> Robust Generalized Point Cloud Registration With Orientational Data Based on Expectation Maximization</a>

---

## Motivation
- the most classical used algorithm for point cloud regristration, ICP ,has several limiation and drawbacks
  - the points in two point cloud must overlap
  - trapped in local minimum
  - susceptible to noise and outliers
  
---

## Keypoints
- registration problem → maximum likelihood (ML) estimation problem （by HMM)
- 
  
---

## Review of ICP algorithm
- two stages: correpsondence stage and registration stage
  - 
- variant: ICP associated with orientation information [37]

## Proposed method

## Observation from experiments

## I have some questions about this paper

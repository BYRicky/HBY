## Motivation <br>
Point clouds of reference and target can be generated by some technique (SfM, LiDAR sensor, Kinect range camera...). Cases in which reference and target point clouds generated by 'different technologies' are rarely discussed. However, in real world, the challenges of corss-source point clouds registration are commonly encountered.

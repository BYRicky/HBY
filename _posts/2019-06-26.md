## Motivation <br>
Point clouds of reference and target can be generated by some technique (SfM, LiDAR sensor, Kinect range camera...). Cases in which reference and target point clouds generated by **different technologies** are rarely discussed. However, in real world, the challenges of corss-source point clouds registration are commonly encountered.

## Introduction
> * One popular point cloud registration: ICP (Iterative Closet Point) <- based on same type of sensor
> * Some challenges for registration of cross-source point cloud 
> 1. different dimension of scale
>     - SfM: no real scale information
>     - LiDAR: can be calibrated through earth coordinates
> 2. different density of point cloud
>     - density(LiDAR) > density(SfM)
> 3. different noise distribution
> 4. point cloud overlapped problem

## Main Algorithm
* Two stages: coarse matching + fine registration
```
coarse matching:
 1. apply multi-scale scanning on LiDAR 
 2. apply ESF-64 on LiDAR and SfM point clouds
 3. select k-best similar LiDAR cloud point cloud regions in each scale for reference (use cosine similarity)
    (Ques: regions? means "points"?)

fine registration:
 1. apply ICP

## Paper
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04630">FAST REGISTRATION FOR CROSS-SOURCE POINT CLOUDS BY USING WEAK
REGIONAL AFFINITY AND PIXEL-WISE REFINEMENT</a>

---

## Motivation
- fusion of cross-source point clouds are challenging since they contain mixture of various differences (density, noise, outliers, viewpoint changing...)

- existing regristration methods assume two point clouds being regristered are in
`strong structure consistency`

---

## Keypoints
**point cloud regristration problem &rarr; tensor optimization problem**
- the weak regional affinity and pixel-wise refinement 
  - are used to maintain the global and local information of 3D point clouds
    - assemble weak regional affinity into three-order tensor
    - assemble pixel-wise refinement into first-order tensor
  - are intergrated into an interative tensor-based regristration algorithm
    - three-order tensor and first-order tensor are integrated into a tensor optimization framework
- two iterative process: optimizations for the correspondence X and geometric transmoration T
  - `iteratively update X and T until convergence`

## Proposed method (Geometric Constraint Tensor-based registration, GCTR)
> **pixel-wise refinement &amp; weak regional affinity** are used to store the information of point cloud <br>
> different to previous separated streams, coaffinity search and pixel-wise refinement is **unified together** <br>
> and jointly considering both local and global information in one unified process

- pixel-wise refinement is the potential `point-to-point` correspondence
  - supposed that point cloud C<sub>1</sub> has N<sub>1</sub> points and point cloud C<sub>2</sub> has N<sub>2</sub> points	
  - H<sub>ii'</sub> is a N<sub>1</sub>xN<sub>2</sub> correspondent point similarity matrix
  - H<sub>ii'</sub> = exp(-dist(f<sub>i</sub>, f<sub>i'</sub>)) the similarity of point i of point cloud C<sub>1</sub> and point i' of point cloud C<sub>2</sub>; dist is Euclidean distance
  - store into first-order tensor (H<sub>ii'</sub> &rarr; H<sub>(i + i'x N<sub>1</sub>)</sub>)
  - `store local information` <br>

- weak regional affinity is the potential `triplet-to-triplet` correspondence
  - triplet points are used to represent weak salient structure of cross-source point cloud
  - triplet points are selected as large `triangles`
  - selection of triplet point: satisfy **wide baseline strategy (???)**
  - three edges of the triangle are large than 50% of the overlapping 3D containing voxelâ€™s the diameter **(???)**
  - randomly select N<sub>1</sub>N<sub>2</sub> triangles in point cloud C<sub>1</sub> (for implementation)
  - H<sub>ii'jj'kk'</sub> is in the size of (N<sub>1</sub>N<sub>2</sub>)<sup>3</sup>
  - point (i, j, k) and point (i', j', k') are triplet points with correspondent relations
  - H<sub>ii'jj'kk'</sub> =  exp(-dist(f<sub>ijk</sub>, f<sub>i'j'k'</sub>)) **how it actually works???**
  - each descriptor f<sub>ijk</sub> contains three cosine value of three inner angles of the triangle (cosine similarity)
  - store into three-order tensor
  - `store global information` <br>
  
- Power iteration solution
  - for cross-source point cloud registration
  - two iterative process: optimizations for the correspondence X and geometric transmoration T
  - `iteratively update X and T until convergence`

## Observation from experiments
- ICP shows some ability in aligning the cross-source point clouds when there is no scale variation and the initialization is very well and no large disorganized outliers.

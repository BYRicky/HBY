## Goal
Provide an illumination-robust visual localization alogrithm for Astrobee*.
(* Astrobee, a free-flying robot designed to autonomously navigate on the International Space Station (ISS))

## Astrobeeâ€™s Current Localization System
- Offline Map Construction + Online Image Localization
  - Offline Map Construction
    - why: operating region is fixed + provide higher stability and accuracy than existing SLAM systems.
    - how: the following four steps <br>
      1. SfM (SURF)
      2. the map with SURF features is rebuilt with `BRISK` binary features. <br>
         - tradeoff between (accurate & robust) and efficiency with respect to SURF features
            - less accurate and robust (critical for accurate offline map building) 
            - faster (critical for online localization)
      3. Registration to ISS Coordinate - the map is registered to the pre-defined ISS coordinate system
      4. Vocabulary Tree Database - constructed for fast retrieval of similar images for localization

## Investigation for changing lighting condition (setup)
- images taken under ten different conditions simulating day, night and intermediate lighting levels on the ISS.
  - for each lighting level: 
      - nearly 2500 images were recorded
      - a digital light meter on a fixed point on the wall measured the luminance in lux.
-

## Observation for changing lighting condition
- dark maps below 45 lux show over an 80% success rate regardless of lighting conditions. 
- bright maps over 60 lux work well only with bright images.
  - why: the feature descriptors cannot describe features in bright lighting conditions well <br>
         because many image intensity values are saturated. <br>
         In dark conditions, saturation rarely occurs.
- the most effective combination for stable localization is <br>
  to use a map constructed in the same lighting conditions as the test images.

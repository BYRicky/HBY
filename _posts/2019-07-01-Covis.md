## Astrobeeâ€™s Current Localization System
- Offline Map Construction + Online Image Localization
  - Offline Map Construction
    - why: operating region is fixed + provide higher stability and accuracy than existing SLAM systems.
    - how: the following four steps <br>
      1. SfM (SURF)
      2. the map with SURF features is rebuilt with `BRISK` binary features. <br>
         less accurate and robust than SURF features 
         (critical for accurate offline map building) 
         but also much faster (critical for online localization).
3. Registration to ISS Coordinate -The map is
registered to the pre-defined ISS coordinate system
4. Vocabulary Tree Database - constructed
for fast retrieval of similar images for localization

## Astrobeeâ€™s Current Localization System
- Offline Map Construction + Online Image Localization
  - Offline Map Construction
    - why: operating region is fixed + provide higher stability and accuracy than existing SLAM systems.
    - how: the following four steps <br>
      1. SfM (SURF)
      2. the map with SURF features is rebuilt with `BRISK` binary features. <br>
         - tradeoff between (accurate & robust) and efficiency with respect to SURF features
            - less accurate and robust (critical for accurate offline map building) 
            - faster (critical for online localization)
      3. Registration to ISS Coordinate -The map is
registered to the pre-defined ISS coordinate system
4. Vocabulary Tree Database - constructed
for fast retrieval of similar images for localization

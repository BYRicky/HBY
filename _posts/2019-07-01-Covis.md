## Paper
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7989640">Robust Visual Localization in Changing Lighting Conditions</a>

---

## Goal
Provide an illumination-robust visual localization alogrithm for Astrobee* <br>
(* a free-flying robot designed to autonomously navigate on the International Space Station (ISS))

---

## Keykey points 
- fetch the current `illumination level`
- select `an appropriate map` <br>
(find the nearest brightness by symmetric KL-divergence value)
- adjust `camera exposure time` <br>
(if the estimated lighting condition is too dark, <br>
 then increasing exposure time, else decreasing)
- camera with `adjustable` exposure time
- operate in the `fixed region`

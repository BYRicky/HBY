## Paper
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03803"> Visual Localization Using Sparse Semantic 3D Map</a>

---

## Motivation
- most traditional mathods fails to locate the camera **under a wide range of viewing conditions variations** including season and illumination changes,as well as weather and day-night varitations.

## Proposed scheme
- combine image-based and structure-based localization with `semantic information`
- separate into three parts:
  - sparase semantic 3D map
    - apply off-the-shelf segmentation CNNs and remove dynamic objects in 3D point cloud
    - M<sub>s</sub> represents a cleaner sparse semenatic 3D map
  
  - semantic score
    - 1. obtain top-k ranked database images I<sub>R</sub> for each query image I<sub>Q</sub> by `NetVLAD`
    - 2. for every selected I<sup>i</sup><sub>R</sub>, find 2D-3D matches through KNN search and ratio test (blue dotted lines)
    - 3. obtain 2D-3D correpsondences between I<sup>i</sup><sub>R</sub> and M<sub>s</sub> (green solid lines)
    
    - 4. obtain 3D-2D matches between M<sub>s</sub> and I<sub>Q</sub> (red solid lines)
    - 5. apply `PnP solver`to recover query pose
    - 6. project all `visiable` 3D points into I<sub>Q</sub> (`visiable` means 3D points should be seen by I<sub>Q</sub>)
    - 7. count # 3D points whose semenatic labels are the same as those in I<sub>Q</sub>
  
  - weighted RANSAC pose estimation
    - 1. 2D-3D matches produced by the same I<sup>i</sup><sub>R</sub> are assigned the semantic score of I<sup>i</sup><sub>R</sub> 
    - 2. normalize each score by the sum of all 2D-3D match socres
    - 3. use the normalized score as a weight p for RANSAC's sampling (different from the removing 2D-3D matches with lower semantic scores)

- Hand-crafted 3D Local Descriptors
  - many of these descriptors are now available in the Point Cloud Library (PCL)
  - are manually designed for specific applications or 3D data types
  - are difficult for them to generalize to new data modalities
  
- Learned 2D Local Descriptors
  - However, in addition to being limited to 2D correspondences on images, multi-view stereo is difficult to 1803 scale up in practice and is prone to error from missing correspondences on textureless or non-Lambertian surfaces, so it is not suitable for learning a 3D surface descriptor??
  
- Learned 3D Global Descriptors
  - for exmample, 3D ShapeNets introduced 3D deep learning for modeling 3D shapes
  - their focus is centered on extracting features from complete 3D object models at a global level

- Learned 3D Local Descriptors
  - [14] uses a 2D ConvNet descriptor to match local geometric features for mesh labeling

## Biography üèÉ
- I'm now a second-year graduate student in [National Chiao Tung University](https://www.nctu.edu.tw/). I received my B.S. from [National Chi Nan University](https://www.ncnu.edu.tw/ncnuweb/) in Jan. 2018.
- My research interests include **reversible data hiding, visual cryptography, digital watermarking, design and analysis of algorithms, and visual localization.** If you are interested in some of my research interests, please have a check to [my paper publications](https://hbyacademic.github.io/HBY/publications/) in conferences and journal.
- I'm a novice in the field of visual localization. To record my learning process, since Jun. 2019, I have written articles about visual localization on [My Website](https://hbyacademic.github.io/HBY/). 
- Since Jan. 2019, I have written articles about image processing on [medium](https://medium.com/@hbyacademic).
- Since Feb. 2017, I have uploaded mini side projects to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmVQun_KSwvPnRBDWSX8gRw/featured) channel, where topics including **image processing, game designing, and something interesting & informative**. The source codes are all released on [Github](https://github.com/hbyacademic). Some image processing effects can be feteched on [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/183031#sketches).
